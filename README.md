# Extended Kalman Filter SLAM
This is matlab code for implementation of Kalman Filter Based SLAM according to the book [Probabilistic Robotics](http://www.probabilistic-robotics.org/) The action model is based on car's steering model, the sensor model is based on feature association model.

And dataset for simulation is from [Victoria Park](http://www-personal.acfr.usyd.edu.au/nebot/victoria_park.htm)

# Usage
To run the demo, directly run the run.m file.

For advanced usage, please check run.m file, there is detailed documantation in there

# Demo Video
The [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/Kz7dmGrOfbM) is on Youtube. It runs the program about 500 iterations
